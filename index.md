## **Welcome to my GitHub page.**

I am currently in the process of building out this GitHub page, so keep your eyes peeled for updates! I will generally upload statistical coding examples from R and Python.

Currently, I am working on tutorials for all the code I've written already contained in my GitHub repositories. If a link for something isn't below, I encourage you to browse my GitHub repositories (click the "View on GitHub" button above!).

Please visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-tat-175542117), my [personal website](www.michelletat.com), or the sites for my Insight Health Data Science projects, [Happy Helper](www.happyhelper.site) and PubMed Topic Modeler, if you would like to know more about me.

## **Links to my Insight Projects** 

[PubMed Topic Modeler](https://github.com/mjtat/PubMed-Topic-Modeler)
* This project takes a keyword search for PubMed, and uses natural language processing to clean and run topic modeling on the retrieved text.

* Notabably, this project was an exercise in implementing more computer science principles, such as object oriented programming, unit testing, and the use of version control in github.

[Happy Helper Notebooks and Scripts](https://github.com/mjtat/Happy-Helper)
* Notebooks ands scripts covering my development process for Happy Helper. Happy Helper was my initial Insight Project that I demoed at various Boston area companies.

* This project takes 90,000 reddit comments from Google BigQuery (specifically from the subreddits /r/anxiety and /r/depression), takes those comments, cleans them up, and implements a classification analysis on the text using various models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes)

* A web app came out of this where a user could input a chunk of text, and it would get classified as being similar to anxious or depressive text. Further, the user would be referred to an appropriate reddit support forum links, where the user input is matched on similarity with posts in that support forum. Check out [Happy Helper](www.happyhelper.site) for an example.

* The webapp was developed using the Flask framework, and deployed using Amazon EC2.

## **Links to pages with statistics completed in R and/or Python**

[Basic Statistics in R](https://github.com/mjtat/Basic-Statistics-in-R-Tutorial)
* Covers descriptives, t-tests, basic ANOVA, and linear regression.


## **Other Fun Stuff**
[Physician Assessment Exercise in R](https://mjtat.github.io/Physician-Assessment-Exercise-in-R/)
* This is a good example of basic data cleaning and organizing.

[Coursera R Programming Assignment, Homework 3 Question 3]( https://mjtat.github.io/Coursera-Programming-Assignment-Homework-3-Question-3/)

* This was part of a homework assignment for John Hopkins University Coursera Course titled "R Programming". It is specifically Question 3 of Homework Assignment 3 (the final homework assignment).

[Plotting of Biosemi Active-2 Event Related Potentials in R (128-Electrode EEG)](https://github.com/mjtat/Plotting-Event-Related-Potentials-using-Biosemi-Active-2-128-Electrode-System-Data)

* This script was designed to extract event-related potentials from a specific EEG dataset collected in a lab I worked in.

[Analysis of COGNISION(tm) Event-Related Potentials in R](https://github.com/mjtat/Plotting-event-related-potentials-in-R). 

* Now using Jupyter Notebooks!

[Analysis of COGNISION(tm) Event-Related Potentials in Python](https://github.com/mjtat/Plotting-Event-Related-Potentials-in-Python). 

* Now using Jupyter Notebooks!
