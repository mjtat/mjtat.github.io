## **Welcome to my GitHub page.**

I am currently in the process of building out this GitHub page, so keep your eyes peeled for updates! I will generally upload statistical coding examples from R and SAS, and some basic coding examples from MySQL.

Currently, I am working on tutorials for all the code I've written already contained in my GitHub repositories. If a link for something isn't below, I encourage you to browse my GitHub repositories (click the "View on GitHub" button above!).

Please visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-tat-175542117), or my [personal website](www.michelletat.com) if you would like to know more about me.
