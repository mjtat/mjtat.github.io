## **Welcome to my GitHub page.**

I am currently in the process of building out this GitHub page, so keep your eyes peeled for updates!

Currently, I am working on tutorials for all the code I've written already contained in my GitHub repositories. If a link for something isn't below, I encourage you to browse my GitHub repositories (click the "View on GitHub" button above!, or click [here](https://github.com/mjtat)).

Please visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-tat-175542117), or the sites for my Insight Health Data Science projects, [Happy Helper](http://www.happyhelper.site) and [PubMed Topic Modeler](https://github.com/mjtat/PubMed-Topic-Modeler), if you would like to know more about me. I also have a [blog](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/seeing-the-random-forest-from-the-decision-trees-an-intuitive-explanation-of-random-forest-beaa2d6a0d80), where I recently wrote a introductory tutorial on Random Forest in R. Feel free to check it out!

## **Links to my Insight Projects** 

[PubMed Topic Modeler](https://github.com/mjtat/PubMed-Topic-Modeler)
* This project takes a keyword search for PubMed, and uses natural language processing to clean and run topic modeling on the retrieved text.

* Notabably, this project was an exercise in implementing more computer science principles, such as object oriented programming, unit testing, and the use of version control in github.

[Happy Helper Notebooks and Scripts](https://github.com/mjtat/Happy-Helper)
* Notebooks ands scripts covering my development process for Happy Helper. Happy Helper was my initial Insight Project that I demoed at various Boston area companies.

* This project takes 90,000 reddit comments from Google BigQuery (specifically from the subreddits /r/anxiety and /r/depression), takes those comments, cleans them up, and implements a classification analysis on the text using various models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes)

* A web app came out of this where a user could input a chunk of text, and it would get classified as being similar to anxious or depressive text. Further, the user would be referred to an appropriate reddit support forum links, where the user input is matched on similarity with posts in that support forum. Check out [Happy Helper](www.happyhelper.site) for an example.

* The webapp was developed using the Flask framework, and deployed using Amazon EC2.

## **Other Fun Stuff**
[Boston 311 Request RShiny Example Dashboard](https://github.com/mjtat/Boston_311_Dashboard)
* This was an exploratory project, where I learned to put together a basic dashboard in RShiny, using the Boston 311 Requests dataset.

[Transgender Natural Language Project](https://github.com/mjtat/Trans-NLP-Project)
* This is an ongoing project where I use natural language processing (e.g.,frequency analyses, document classification, word embeddings) to examine the concerns of the transgender community. [You can read more about it on my blog](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/nlp-for-the-lgbtqia-community-a-primer-on-natural-language-processing-part-1-7f0ffd1bb54d). This project was written in Python.

[Plotting of Biosemi Active-2 Event Related Potentials in R (128-Electrode EEG)](https://github.com/mjtat/Plotting-Event-Related-Potentials-using-Biosemi-Active-2-128-Electrode-System-Data)

* This script was designed to extract event-related potentials from a specific EEG dataset collected in a lab I worked in.

[Analysis of COGNISION(tm) Event-Related Potentials in R](https://github.com/mjtat/Plotting-event-related-potentials-in-R). 

* Now using Jupyter Notebooks!

### Updated 5/12/2017
* Added links to repos for the Boston 311 dashboard, transgender NLP project, and removed some older repos from the listing.
