I will generally upload statistical coding examples from R, and some basic coding examples from MySQL.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am working on tutorials for all the code I've written already contained in my GitHub repositories. If a link for something isn't below, I encourage you to browse my GitHub repositories (click the \"View on GitHub\" button above!).\r\n\r\nPlease visit [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-tat-175542117), or my [personal website](www.michelletat.com) if you would like to know more about me.\r\n\r\n## **Links to pages with statistics completed in R**\r\n\r\n[Descriptive Statistics in R](https://mjtat.github.io/R-Examples-Descriptives/)\r\n\r\n[Correlations in R](https://mjtat.github.io/R-Examples-Correlations/)\r\n\r\n[Between-Subjects T-tests in R](http://mjtat.github.io/R-Examples-T-Tests-Between-Subjects/)\r\n\r\n[Within-Subjects T-tests in R](https://mjtat.github.io/R-Examples-T-Tests-Between-Subjects/)\r\n\r\n[Multiple Regression in R](https://mjtat.github.io/R-Examples-Multiple-Regression/)\r\n\r\n[Binomial Logistic Regression in R](https://mjtat.github.io/R-Examples-Logistic-Regression/)\r\n\r\n## **Other Fun Stuff**\r\n[Physician Assessment Exercise in R](https://mjtat.github.io/Physician-Assessment-Exercise-in-R/)\r\n* This is a good example of basic data cleaning and organizing.\r\n\r\n[Coursera R Programming Assignment, Homework 3 Question 1](https://mjtat.github.io/Coursera-Programming-Assignment-Homework-3-Question-1/)\r\n\r\n* This was part of a homework assignment for John Hopkins University Coursera Course titled \"R Programming\".
